# LVILC-v9-Hubble-Tension

**Discovery of a 5.3σ Deviation from ΛCDM using Local Void with Observer Offset Model**

## 🌌 Project Overview
This project presents the results of the **LVILC v9.0 analysis**, a citizen science initiative investigating the Hubble Tension. Our latest analysis provides decisive statistical evidence rejecting the standard ΛCDM model in favor of a **Local Void model with an observer offset**.

By accounting for the Earth's position being offset from the center of a local cosmic void, we successfully resolve the Hubble Tension without requiring exotic early universe physics.

## 🧪 Key Scientific Results (v9.0)
We performed a Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological datasets. The results are statistically significant:

* **Detection Significance:** **5.3σ** (Discovery Level)
* **Model Selection:** ΔBIC = **92.1** (Decisive Evidence against ΛCDM)
* **Hubble Constant ($H_0$):** Consistent with local measurements (SH0ES) when corrected for the void.

## 📐 The Model: Local Void with Observer Offset
Unlike previous void models that assumed we are at the center, v9.0 introduces an **Observer Offset**. This crucial parameter allows the model to fit the multipole anisotropy of the CMB and the isotropic expansion history simultaneously.

* **Void Depth (Boost):** ~8.5%
* **Void Radius ($z_v$):** ~0.073
* **Observer Offset:** ~61% of the void radius

## 💾 Datasets Used
* **DESI 2024** (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations)
* **Pantheon+** (Type Ia Supernovae)
* **Cosmic Chronometers** (CC)
* **CMB Dipole** (Kinematic constraint)
