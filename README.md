proposes the universe is inside a single giant black hole, with us eternally falling toward its center. The "expansion" is an illusion from horizon dilation, accelerating time. This explains dark energy and fits DESI 2025/JWST data, with H0 at -6.73 ± 0.96 km/s/Mpc due to early black hole growth. Supported by MCMC and SN 2025wny time delays.
